## statement of problem
what is the Boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from the starting
position to treasure”

## recursive abstraction

When I am asked to\
	determine the Boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure"\
The recursive abstraction can\
	determine the Boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from a position with one less choice than the starting positon to the treasure"\

Hanna's Version:\
When I am asked to
  find a path to the end of the maze beginning on this “stepping stone on a legit path,”\
The recursive abstraction can\
  find a path to the end of the maze beginning on a “stepping stone on a legit path” next to the one that I was asked to find\
Michelle's Version: \
When I am asked to find a solution for the explorer to
find the treasure in a path with n choices, the recursion
abstraction can find a solution for the explorer to find the
treasure in a path with n-1 choices
## base case
## English or pseudocode description of algorithm
## class(es), with fields and methods
## version n wishlist
- one possible way
- all possible ways
- shortest path 
- visualize the path
